/**
 * \file
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * Definition of methods for using a HID keyboard device driver.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * -# Re-implement the usbd_callbacks_request_received callback to forward
 *    requests to hidd_keyboard_driver_request_handler. This is done
 *    automatically unless the NOAUTOCALLBACK symbol is defined during
 *    compilation.
 * -# Initialize the driver using hidd_keyboard_driver_initialize. The
 *    USB driver is automatically initialized by this method.
 * -# Call the hidd_keyboard_driver_change_keys method when one or more
 *    keys are pressed/released.
