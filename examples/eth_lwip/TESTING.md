ETH_LWIP EXAMPLE
============

# Objectives
------------
This project implements webserver example by using lwIP stack, It enables the
device to act as a web server, sending a very short page when accessed through
a browser.

# Example Description
---------------------
The program will read the MAC address from the AT24MAC EEPROM if it is
available. Then configure the GMAC with a default IP address ( / MAC address)
and ask the transceiver to auto-negotiate the best mode of operation. Once this
is done, it will initialize lwIP modules and HTTP sever application.
Please refer to the lwIP documentation for more information about the TCP/IP
stack and the webserver example.

# Test
------
## Supported targets
--------------------
* SAMA5D2-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK
* SAMA5D3-EK
* SAMA5D3-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D4-EK
* SAMA5D4-XPLAINED
* SAME70-XPLAINED
* SAMV71-XPLAINED

## Setup
--------
 - On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
(e.g. HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:

     - 115200 bauds
     - 8 bits of data
     - No parity
     - 1 stop bit
     - No flow control

 - Connect an Ethernet cable between the board and the network.

     - The board may be connected directly to a computer; in this case,make sure to use a cross/twisted wired cable such as the one provided with the board.
     - Make sure the IP adress of the computer is in the same network as the device (192.168.1.0/24, the board is at 192.168.1.3).

## Start the application
------------------------

The following test will be printed if successful.

*Type the IP address of the device in a web browser, http://192.168.1.3*

Tested with IAR and GCC (sram and ddram configuration)
In order to test this example, the process is the following:

Step | Description | Expected Result | Result
-----|-------------|-----------------|-------
Open http://192.168.1.3 in a web browser. | The page generated by lwIP will appear in the web browser, like below: ``Small test page.`` | PASSED | PASSED
